      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        TechCon was founded in 2015 as a small gathering of local developers and innovators in East Africa. 
        What started as a one-day meetup with 120 attendees has grown into one of the continent's leading 
        technology conferences. Over the past nine years, we've hosted more than 15,000 participants from 
        40+ countries, featuring cutting-edge talks on AI, blockchain, sustainable tech, and digital inclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        From humble beginnings in a university auditorium to a multi-day event at premier venues, TechCon 
        continues to evolve while staying true to its mission of making advanced technology accessible and 
        relevant to African challenges and opportunities.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        TechCon exists to bridge the gap between emerging technologies and real-world impact. We believe that 
        innovation should serve communities, solve local problems, and create inclusive economic opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our core principles include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accessibility – making advanced tech knowledge available to underrepresented groups</li>
        <li>Relevance – focusing on technologies that address African priorities</li>
        <li>Collaboration – fostering connections between students, startups, enterprises, and researchers</li>
        <li>Sustainability – promoting ethical and environmentally conscious innovation</li>
      </ul>
